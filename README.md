## react-redux-ssr setup development kit

this is a minimum bare setup for development of **react-redux-ssr** projects ready to be published/deployed on **nodejs** hosting services.

you do **npm i --production** if you don't want to develop. but because this is not the case, you do **npm i** instead.

after that you do **npm run dev** to develop.

when you want to publish/deploy you do **npm run build** first.

the build of this project has been published to **heroku** and can be accessed (the site) through https://react-redux-ssr.herokuapp.com.
