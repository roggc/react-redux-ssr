# reactReduxSSR

make sure you first run 'npm run build' after 'npm install' and then 'npm run dev' for subsequent development. if not you would get to run 'npm run dev' twice the first time because the first one crashes (it takes more time for webpack to create output folders and files and nodemon crashes).

this project has been published to heroku and can be accessed (the site) through 'https://react-redux-ssr.herokuapp.com'. so this 'react-redux-ssr' setup installation it is ready for publishing/deploying on node js hosting services.
